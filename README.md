Just Press Play is an achievement system developed in RIT's Media, Arts, Games, Interaction & Creativity (MAGIC) Center, which adds a playful activity layer to our undergraduates' daily life. It is intended to encourage students to engage in a playful way with their educational environments and experiences, to reflect on their accomplishments, and to strengthen their sense of competence and progress.

You can see a reference implementation of the RIT version of Just Press Play running at http://jpp-rit-sandbox.azurewebsites.net/

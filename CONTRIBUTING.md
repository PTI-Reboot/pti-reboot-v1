# Contributing to Just Press Play

Hi, and thanks for your interest in JPP! Follow our [environment setup guide](https://github.com/RIT-MAGIC/JustPressPlay/wiki/Development-Environment-Setup-Guide) to get the solution running on your machine.

## Communication

Our feature and bug discussion happens in GitHub issues and pull requests. Please use those channels to discuss this project.

## Git Workflow

JPP uses [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as its branching model.

All major features or enhancements being added are done on feature branches, then merged to develop through pull requests. Pull requests should be named as `Type: Name`, where `Type` could be `Feature`, `Refactor`, `Cleanup`, etc.

## Issue Tracking

We use the issues page to track what work is being completed. Below is the list of lables we use to do this tracking. If you're looking for something to work on, "ready" issues that aren't "in-progress" are perfect. If you think of a cool feature or find a bug, create a new issue with the appropriate labels and a description, and be sure to add the proposal tag. Our team will review the issue and either approve or deny it, and post a reason why.

### Issue Labels

* **Bug**: It's a bug. Describe how you found it and how to replicate it.
* **Feature**: A new feature for the site. Describe what it should do and how it should work.
* **High Priority**: Issues that need immediate attention.
* **In Progress**: Issues that are actively being worked on. The developer working on this issue should be listed in the "Assigned" field of the issue.
* **Proposal**: New issues (features, bugs) should be marked with this label until reviewed by the core team.
* **Question**: Question for the developers about any technical aspect of Just Press Play. Answers will be posted on the issue.
* **Ready**: Issues that are ready for implementation. Issues that aren't ready for implementation should depend on issues that are, and should be noted in the description.
